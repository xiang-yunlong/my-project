**Educational Repository for Learning Open Source Contributions**

This repository contains intentionally seeded bugs designed to help new contributors learn the open source contribution workflow. It provides a safe, beginner-friendly environment to practice fixing issues, submitting pull requests, and collaborating with maintainers.

## Project Description

Retro Dungeon Workshop is a text-based roguelike game that runs entirely in the terminal. Explore procedurally generated dungeons, battle enemies, collect items, and survive as long as you can in this classic-style adventure game.

## Features

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation** - Every playthrough generates unique dungeon layouts with rooms, corridors, and hidden areas
- **Turn-Based Combat** - Strategic combat system with attack, defense, and special abilities
- **Inventory System** - Collect and manage items including weapons, armor, potions, and treasures
- **Save/Load System** - Persist your progress and continue your adventure later
- **Multiple Enemy Types** - Face various enemies with different behaviors and abilities
- **Classic Roguelike Mechanics** - Permadeath, procedural generation, and strategic gameplay

## Learning Objectives

This project helps you learn:

- The complete open source contribution workflow
- Git branching and commit practices
- Code review processes
- Testing and continuous integration
- C++ best practices and modern C++20 features
- Working with CMake build systems

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- CMake 3.28 or higher
- C++20 compatible compiler (GCC 10+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019+)
- Git

### Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anxkhn/retro-dungeon-workshop.git
cd retro-dungeon-workshop

# Configure and build
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Run the game
./build/bin/retro_dungeon
```

### Installing Dependencies

Catch2 is automatically fetched via CMake FetchContent during the build process. No manual installation required.

## Using github.dev

github.dev provides a browser-based VS Code environment for quick edits:

1. Navigate to the repository on GitHub
2. Press `.` (period) or change the URL from `github.com` to `github.dev`
3. Make your changes directly in the browser
4. Use the Source Control panel to commit and push changes
5. Create a pull request from your branch

This is ideal for small fixes and documentation updates without setting up a local development environment.
